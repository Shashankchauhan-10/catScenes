# CatScenes
Analysis code for the Categorical Scenes / BOLD5000 project

## TO DO 
This code repository is up to date as of 03.25.2022

- Process new analog data. 
- Calculate tuning curves for analog data. 
- Calculate distance metric between each participant and all other participants for each image. 
- (optionally, we could try this for a number of different tuning curves)
- Correlate that metric per participant with their VVIQ scores. 

- Compare analog & linguistic data. 
- Qualitative comparisons by comparing the tuning curve data to the linguistic histograms. 
- Quantitative comparison by plotting the images based on how similar their analog & linguistic responses are. 
    - Compute similarity score for each image, averaging analog and linguistic.
    - Examine images that have high and low similarity scores. 
    - Use this to guide our selection of images for the VVIQ correlations (high agreement or low agreement images?)


- Examing VVIQ differences by gender (anything else? SBSOD)

- If time, examine brain data with image metrics.
